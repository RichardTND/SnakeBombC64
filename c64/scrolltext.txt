(c) 2022 the new dimension ...   this game was written specially for the snake fun compo 2022 ...   and now it is time for the game instructions ...    this is quite an easy game, but will get even harder as you progress through the game ...   plug a joystick into port 2 or use neighbouring cursor keys to move your snake ...   the object of this game is to guide your snake through the tunnel eating scrumptious fruit that comes along on screen ...   the scoring is based on the fruit in which you eat, but avoid touching the bombs otherwise the game will be over ...   keep on scoring as many points as you possibly can and try to reach the end of the tunnel ...    good luck! ...     press fire to play! ...                                                          @
